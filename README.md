Challenger 1P emulator to be used with my OSI Challenger 1P reproduction.

So far I have a basic working emulator of a Challenger 1P personal computer running the default SYSMON monitor or alternately the more capable third party CEGMON monitor.  This includes virtual display, keyboard, and cassette tapes. 

This work is based on the project docmarionum1/py65emu with thanks.

Python dependencies that I know of: PyGame
