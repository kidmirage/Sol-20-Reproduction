# Sol-20-Reproduction
Sol-20 emulator to be used with my Sol-20 reproduction.

So far I have a basic working emulator of a Sol-20 personal computer running the Solos "Personality Module".  This includes virtual display, keyboard, and cassette tapes. 

This work is based on the project matthewmpalen/py8080 with thanks.

The only Python dependency I know of is PyGame.
